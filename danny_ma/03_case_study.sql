-- C. Challenge Payment Question

-- The Foodie-Fi team wants you to create a new payments table for the year 2020 that includes amounts paid by each customer in the subscriptions table with the following requirements:
-- -- monthly payments always occur on the same day of month as the original start_date of any monthly paid plan
-- -- upgrades from basic to monthly or pro plans are reduced by the current paid amount in that month and start immediately
-- -- upgrades from pro monthly to pro annual are paid at the end of the current billing period and also starts at the end of the month period
-- -- once a customer churns they will no longer make payments

-- D. Outside The Box Questions

-- -- The following are open ended questions which might be asked during a technical interview for this case study - there are no right or wrong answers, but answers that make sense from both a technical and a business perspective make an amazing impression!

-- How would you calculate the rate of growth for Foodie-Fi?
-- What key metrics would you recommend Foodie-Fi management to track over time to assess performance of their overall business?
-- What are some key customer journeys or experiences that you would analyse further to improve customer retention?
-- If the Foodie-Fi team were to create an exit survey shown to customers who wish to cancel their subscription, what questions would you include in the survey?
-- What business levers could the Foodie-Fi team use to reduce the customer churn rate? How would you validate the effectiveness of your ideas?
