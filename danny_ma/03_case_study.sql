-- A. Customer Journey

-- Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the subscriptions table, write a brief description about each customerâ€™s onboarding journey.
-- Try to keep it as short as possible - you may also want to run some sort of join to make your explanations a bit easier!

-- B. Data Analysis Questions

-- How many customers has Foodie-Fi ever had?
-- What is the monthly distribution of trial plan start_date values for our dataset - use the start of the month as the group by value
-- What plan start_date values occur after the year 2020 for our dataset? Show the breakdown by count of events for each plan_name
-- What is the customer count and percentage of customers who have churned rounded to 1 decimal place?
-- How many customers have churned straight after their initial free trial - what percentage is this rounded to the nearest whole number?
-- What is the number and percentage of customer plans after their initial free trial?
-- What is the customer count and percentage breakdown of all 5 plan_name values at 2020-12-31?
-- How many customers have upgraded to an annual plan in 2020?
-- How many days on average does it take for a customer to an annual plan from the day they join Foodie-Fi?
-- Can you further breakdown this average value into 30 day periods (i.e. 0-30 days, 31-60 days etc)
-- How many customers downgraded from a pro monthly to a basic monthly plan in 2020?

-- C. Challenge Payment Question

-- The Foodie-Fi team wants you to create a new payments table for the year 2020 that includes amounts paid by each customer in the subscriptions table with the following requirements:
-- -- monthly payments always occur on the same day of month as the original start_date of any monthly paid plan
-- -- upgrades from basic to monthly or pro plans are reduced by the current paid amount in that month and start immediately
-- -- upgrades from pro monthly to pro annual are paid at the end of the current billing period and also starts at the end of the month period
-- -- once a customer churns they will no longer make payments

-- D. Outside The Box Questions

-- -- The following are open ended questions which might be asked during a technical interview for this case study - there are no right or wrong answers, but answers that make sense from both a technical and a business perspective make an amazing impression!

-- How would you calculate the rate of growth for Foodie-Fi?
-- What key metrics would you recommend Foodie-Fi management to track over time to assess performance of their overall business?
